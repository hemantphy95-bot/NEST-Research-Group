<h1 class="section-title">Research Overview</h1>

<p style="max-width:900px; margin:auto;">
Our research program integrates controlled synthesis, ion-beam modification, and advanced structural characterization to design functional materials capable of operating under extreme thermal, radiation, and optical environments. The overarching goal is to establish predictive structure–property relationships that guide the development of next-generation energy, nuclear, and photonic materials.

<div class="research-text">
<h2>Ion Beam Engineering & Irradiation-Induced Phenomena</h2>
<p>
We investigate the interaction of energetic ions with materials to understand defect generation, ion-induced mixing, thermal spike effects, and irradiation-driven structural transformations. Using swift heavy ions and low-energy implantation, we explore controlled modification of morphology, phase stability, and defect landscapes in metals, semiconductors, and complex alloys.
</p>
<p>
Through irradiation experiments combined with damage profiling techniques such as RBS and channeling, and advanced electron microscopy, we establish mechanistic insights into radiation tolerance, defect evolution, and ion-beam-driven microstructural engineering relevant to nuclear and high-energy environments.

<div class="research-text">
<h2>Nanomaterials Synthesis & Nanoscale Structural Evolution</h2>
<p>
We focus on the controlled synthesis of metallic and alloy nanoparticles, thin films, and dielectric–metal nanocomposites using chemical reduction, sputtering, ion implantation, and laser-assisted techniques. Emphasis is placed on nucleation mechanisms, compositional tuning, phase formation, and size-dependent thermodynamic stability in confined nanoscale systems.
</p>
<p>
A major research theme involves investigating the structural phase behavior of bulk-immiscible bimetallic systems at the nanoscale. While certain alloy systems exhibit large miscibility gaps in bulk form, nanoscale confinement can significantly modify thermodynamic equilibria, enabling metastable solid solutions or compositionally modulated structures. Using in-situ heating TEM and synchrotron GISAXS/GIWAXS, we systematically study nanoscale phase stability and alloy evolution.

<div class="research-text">
<h2>Plasmonic & Functional Nanomaterials for Nanoelectronics and Nanophotonics</h2>
<p>
We investigate plasmonic and functional nanomaterials based on metallic and alloy nanoparticles (Ag, Au, AgAu, AgPt) embedded within dielectric matrices, with emphasis on optical response, thermal stability, and nanoscale structure–property relationships. Particular attention is given to systems where nanoscale confinement enables tunable plasmonic behavior.
</p>
<p>
Applications include optical limiting for laser protection, nonlinear optical switches, ultrafast photonic components, plasmon-enhanced sensing platforms, and light–matter interaction engineering at subwavelength scales.
</p>
<p>
Optical functionality is probed using Z-scan techniques to evaluate third-order nonlinear optical coefficients, photoluminescence spectroscopy for defect and emission studies, spectroscopic ellipsometry for dielectric function determination, and Raman spectroscopy for vibrational and interfacial analysis.

<div class="research-text">
<h2>High Entropy Alloys & Materials for Extreme Environments</h2>
<p>
We study vanadium-based, aluminum-based, and high entropy alloy systems designed for structural stability, radiation tolerance, and high-temperature performance. Our investigations focus on defect dynamics, phase stability, compositional complexity, and nanoscale heterogeneity under irradiation and thermal exposure.
</p>
<p>
By correlating irradiation response with microstructural evolution, we contribute to the rational design of next-generation structural materials for nuclear reactors, fusion systems, aerospace, and advanced energy technologies.
